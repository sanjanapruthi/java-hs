# High School Java Projects
This repository contains some of the projects I created in high school using Java.
I took **AP Computer Science** from September 2015 - June 2016 and **Data Structures & Game Design** from September 2017 - June 2018

## AP Computer Science: September 2015 - June 2016

### Breakout
This is a recreation of Atari Breakout. It was my final project in AP Computer Science. 

To play, run the file "Breakout.java" and then use the arrow keys.

## Data Structures & Game Design: September 2017 - June 2018

### Maze
This is a game that requires the user to navigate a maze. The maze is stored and can be edited in the text file "maze1.txt". When run, the program displays two mazes: a 2D one on the left that allows users to have an aerial view of the maze, and a 3D one on the right that allows users to play as if they are physically going through the maze. 

To play, run the file "MazeProgram.java".

### Sound Matrix
This program allows you to create and play music. Select the buttons corresponding to the notes you desire in order to create music and use the scroll bar on the bottom to adjust the speed. When you're ready, press play to listen to your masterpiece! Or, if desired, you can choose from one of the pre-existing melodies to play. 

To play, run the file "SoundMatrix.java".

### Hungry Bunnies

This game uses the keys to allow users to navigate bunnies (created with sprite sheets) in order to collect carrots. It has both a one player mode and a two player mode, as well as an option to view the instructions.

To play, run the file "GameTemplate.java".

### Jumping Turtles

This game requires the user to collect coins while avoiding enemies (the bees). It uses a side scroller for the background.

To play, run the file "Game.java"
