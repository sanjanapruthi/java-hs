# High School Java Projects
This repository contains some of the projects I created in high school using Java.
I took **AP Computer Science** from September 2015 - June 2016 and **Data Structures & Game Design** from September 2017 - June 2018

## AP Computer Science: September 2015 - June 2016

### Breakout
This is a recreation of Atari Breakout. It was my final project in AP Computer Science. To play, run the file "Breakout.java" and then use the arrow keys.

## Data Structures & Game Design: September 2017 - June 2018

### Maze
This is a game that requires the user to navigate a maze. The maze is stored and can be edited in the text file "maze1.txt". When run, the program displays two mazes: a 2D one on the left that allows users to have an aerial view of the maze, and a 3D one on the right that allows users to play as if they are physically going through the maze. To play, run the file "MazeProgram.java".
